## Overall Learning 

This internship strengthened my understanding of embedded systems fundamentals through hands-on, mentor-validated learning.
I gained practical experience in Arduino, bare-metal programming, ESP32, and FreeRTOS with real hardware–software integration.
The program improved my ability to design, debug, and optimize real-time embedded and IoT systems.
Responsible use of AI tools enhanced analysis and documentation while reinforcing core engineering judgment.
